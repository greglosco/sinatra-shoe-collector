## Usage

A user can login with existing login credentials or sign up for a new account with a username, email, and password. From the homepage, a user can view their shoe collection, add a new shoe to their collection, log out, or delete their account. A user can add a new shoe to their collection by providing a name, brand, and color. Once added, a user can edit the shoe details, view their entire shoe collection, add another shoe to their collection, or delete the shoe from their collection.
